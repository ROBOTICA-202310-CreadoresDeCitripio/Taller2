[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find<dependency>.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "<dependency>", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "<dependency>" with
  any of the following names:

    <dependency>Config.cmake
    <dependency>-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "<dependency>" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "<dependency>_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "<dependency>" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
